● cp - chest pain type 

● trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) 

● chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl 

● fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) 

● restecg - resting electrocardiographic results 

● thalach - maximum heart rate achieved 

● exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) 

● oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 

● slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 

● ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 

● thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
